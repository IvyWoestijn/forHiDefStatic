# Centered Square
Create a Python program that prints a square.
The edges should be pluses (+') and in the exact center,
there should be an oh (`o`).

Because it is only possible to place the `o` is in the exact center,
the size of the square has to odd. Moreover, the `o` should always
be visible, which makes 3 the smallest input.
Hence, keep asking for input, until it is valid.

These are the three smallest possible squares:
> 3
+++
+o+
+++


> 5
+++++
+   +
+ o +
+   +
+++++


> 7
+++++++
+     +
+     +
+  o  +
+     +
+     +
+++++++
