# Digit Swap
Read one number (`int`) as input.

If the number has exactly two digits, the program swaps both digits.
Otherwise the number is printed as is.
The sign of the number is **always** preserved.

**Hint 1:** The input is a number, do not try to convert is to a string.
**Hint 2:** Do not use the internet: the first solution(s) you will find
are wrong !

## Examples:
    > 1234
    1234

    > -1234
    -1234

    > -4
    -4

    > 6
    6

    > 34
    43

    > -12
    -21

    > -70
    -7
