# Average Differences
Write the function `average_differences(people, age)`.
This function should compute
- the average age of the people younger than the given age, and
- the average age of the people older than the given age.
The function `average_differences` should return the positive
difference between the two.

**Hint 1:** Do not write the same code twice if you have written
some parts for this program already.
**Hint 2:** Copy-paste is NOT what I mean, try an import?
