# Split and Count
In the following three assignments, we will be working with (lists of) people.
One person is represented as a dictionary containing a `name` and an `age`:
```Python
{"name": "Alice",  "age": 30}
```

Write the function `split_by_age(people, age)` which partitions a list
into three list:
- the people younger than age;
- the people older than age; and
- the people who are exactly 'age' years old.

That is why the function `split_by_age` should return a dictionary
with these three lists. Check the tests, to figure out what the keys
of this dictionary are.

Second, write a function `count_by_age(people, age)` which counts the
number of people of the given age. Try to write as few lines of code
as possible (reuse).
