"""
Write the functions
`reverse`,
`is_palindrome`,
`sub_str`,
`find`,
`find_all`,
 `replace`, and
 `decompose`
 such that all tests succeed.

The key of this exercise is to start small: make your
function work for simple and small inputs. Just like in
the previous exercise the key is to reuse existing functions.

*If the functionality you need already exists in
(a) Python (library), try to implement it yourself.
The exercise here is to write code, not to borrow it.*
