"""
Implement the functions
`extreme`,
`shift_to_positive`,
`shift_to_positive_in_place`,
`sort`, and
`sort_copy` such that all tests succeed.

`extreme` searches the smallest or largest element in a list.
The second (optional) argument decides whether to pick the smallest (default).

`shift_values_to_positive` creates a list with the same elements as the input
list, but ensures that all elements are positive by shifting them all with
the smallest possible number (if needed).

`shift_to_positive_in_place` does the exact same thing *in place* , the
original list is updated.

Take a look at the tests to see how we verify both functions.


`sort`, and `sort_copy` both take a list with numbers as input and returns a
list with the same numbers from low to high (sorted). The difference is that
`sort` is *in-place*, i.e., the original list is updated and that `sort_copy`
creates a new list.

**Hint:** Take a look at this algorithm ans try to translate the English
text into Python code. The algorithm is not part of this courses material.

If the functionality you need already exists in
(a) Python (library), try to implement it yourself.
The exercise here is to write code, not to borrow it.
